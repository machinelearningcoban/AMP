# Demo 

Run file `sparse_recovery_demo_pos1.m`.

**Note:** Since ICR is time comsumming, the default code doesn't run ICR. To run and see its performance:

1. Open `sparse_recovery_demo_pos1.m`.

2. Comment line 98.

3. Uncomment line 96 and 97.

4. Run `sparse_recovery_demo_pos1.m` again. 

# Selected Experimental Results 

## Simulated data 
We perform one experiment with sparse data that is naturally non-negative and vary the sparsity level of x_0 from 10 to 120 and compare the running time, MSE, optimal cost function and SM of different methods. Results are shown in Figure below. Similar trends can be seen in this figure where AMP requires less running time than ICR does while it consistently outperforms others in the remaining aspects. It is worth to mention that AMP and ICR obtain almost the identical cost which is better than what SpaRSA achieves.

Note: dictionary size: 512 x 256.
